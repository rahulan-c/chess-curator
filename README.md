# chess-curator

A collection of scripts under development for identifying interesting things about a set of chess games:

- (Probable) piece sacrifices
- Games that ended in a known checkmate pattern
- Stats about observed 7-piece tablebase positions
- Stats about endgames
- Stats about tactics

Currently designed to work on Lichess game collection PGNs that include eval data. Anything else won't fly.
